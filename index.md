I am Sabir Bagwan. My interest lies in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am a self-taught individual, still learning from the open-source community online.

Python is the language of my choosing and I love to work and automate stuff with it. This website is where I like to document some of my work.

You can reach out for any interesting work/research related field.
