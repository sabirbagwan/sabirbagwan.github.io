Transformers are a type of deep learning architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language-related tasks. The transformer architecture was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017.

Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process sequences step-by-step, transformers rely on a self-attention mechanism to capture relationships between different positions within a sequence. This mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, enabling parallel processing and efficient computation.

The key components of a transformer architecture are:

Encoder: The encoder receives input sequences and applies self-attention mechanisms to capture the dependencies between different words or tokens in the sequence. It processes the entire sequence in parallel, eliminating the sequential processing bottleneck of RNNs. The encoder consists of multiple layers, each containing multi-head self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks.
